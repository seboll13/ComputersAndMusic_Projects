## COM-418 Spatial Audio Final Project
The project folder contains this readme, a single jupyter notebook and a folder of wav files used for testing purposes.

The notebook is pretty much self explanatory. The only thing that is required prior to running all cells is to install the Python packages ```spaudiopy``` and ```pyroomacoustics```; links for this can be found directly in the notebook.
